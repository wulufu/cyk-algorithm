# ICSI 409 CYK Algorithm Implementation
Wolfgang Neal, Alex Bailey, Collin Smith, Ishtyaq Khan, Jack Arevalo


## Description
This script creates a context-free grammar from a text file and uses it to
perform CYK on strings input by the user. The name for this file can be
provided using '-f' or '--file' when running the script, otherwise the user
will be prompted for it. The program will exit if the file is not found.

## Installation
In order to setup the project, you can copy the URL from the github repository and
clone the repository, using the VCS from your IDE. Once the project files are loaded into the IDE Run the script with the CFG file as an argument.
Enter strings to test against the CFG. Repeat testing or exit the program using the test files that are provided in the folder.

## Usage
Each line in the file must be of the form "A -> BC", "S -> epsilon", or
"A -> a", where 'A', 'B', and 'C' are variables, 'S' is the axiom, and 'a' is
a terminal. Optionally, two or more rules with the same left-hand side can be
combined into one line using the form "A -> BC | a".

A variable that appears on the right-hand side of a rule must also be
defined on the left-hand side of at least one rule. The first variable
to be defined is assumed to be the axiom of the CFG. If any rule in the file
is formatted incorrectly, the program will exit.

Once the CFG is created, the user will be prompted to enter a string.
CYK will be performed on this string, and the result will be displayed.
This will repeat indefinitely until the program is terminated.

This file can also be imported as a module to gain access to the CFG class for
testing whether strings can be generated by a context-free grammar, along with
the CFGFormatError exception, raised when attempting to create a CFG from an
invalid list of rules.
